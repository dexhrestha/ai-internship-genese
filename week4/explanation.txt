Explanation of Assignment Week 4:

In this lab we use AWS Rekognition API to find the facial feaures of input image. I have provided 3 endpoints in my application 
1. /search_url
This endpoint accepts POST form data with URL of image as input. The filename is extracted from URL to check whether the given URL contains an image. 
The accepted extensions are JPG,PNG and JPEG. The image is then passed through a function which calls the AWS Rekognition API using Boto3 client. 
Boto3 is a Python package that provides interfaces to Amazon Web Services and stable version of Boto. The response json from the API was then processed to provide required 
outputs such as Gender, Emotions etc.

2. /search_upload
This endpoint accepts POST form data with image file as input. The image is  validated and then uploaded to s3. The method to  upload to s3 returns a URL of that particular image. Then using the same function as above we get tyhe desired processed output. The file is then deleted using boto after performing analysis.
3. /api/search_url
This endpoint provides the processed response from Rekognition API in json format os that it can be used for other applications.
