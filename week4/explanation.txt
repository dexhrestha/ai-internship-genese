Explanation of Assignment Week 4:

In this lab we use AWS Rekognition API to find the facial feaures of input image. I have provided 3 endpoints in my application 
1. /search_url
This endpoint accepts POST form data with URL of image as input. The filename is extracted from URL to check whether the given URL contains an image. 
The accepted extensions are JPG,PNG and JPEG. The image is then passed through a function which calls the AWS Rekognition API using Boto3 client. 
Boto3 is a Python package that provides interfaces to Amazon Web Services and stable version of Boto.
